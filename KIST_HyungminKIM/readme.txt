Proceedure..
1. Run the 'Training' folder, based on E-prime 3.0 with Black Box ToolKit USB TTL.
2. Record EEG data via BrainVision Recorder (Brain Products) through RDA Matlab. use PRDA_DataAcq.m' with pnet.mexw64, mind the Marker preference! 
3. Prepare the training data(3 class, gaitMI/sitMI/donothing), refer the 'Modelingdata_sample.mat' (small iteration due to file size).
4. Run 'FBCSP_Offline_Modeling.m' to prepare prerequisits for online code.
5. Run 'FBCSP_Online.m.
